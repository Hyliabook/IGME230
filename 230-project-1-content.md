Name Subject to Change

**Katamari DemaSEA?  A Hungry Seagull Destroys The World!**

### Genre
This game is a flying casual game, mixed with a "Grower Game-" think Katamari.

### Platform
Desktop and mobile.

## Story

Seamore is a very hungry seagull, and a special hungry seagull.  The more he eats, the bigger he grows, and the hungrier he gets!  If he grows large enough, who knows what he could eat?

The whole theme is whimisical wackiness- an attempt to get as big as possible to eat the largest objects.  That's all there is to it.

## Esthetics

The art style will be cartoony, of course.  The music: whimisical, crazy music, cartoon sound effects- for things such as eating, diving, signifigant growth, achievements, etc.

## Gameplay

### Mechanics

The player plays as a bird, who when eating objects of a smaller mass, grows- allowing them to eat larger objects. The player "flies" in a similar manner to Flappy Bird- constant little bursts of flight while constantly moving forward- however you are limitied.  The game is split into two sections: the air, and the sea.  In the air, you're limited by your "flight energy-" when that runs out, you return to the sea surface to "coast" on the seabreeze, refilling your energy.  Underwater, you're limited by Oxygen- when that runs out, you return to the surface to get air.  You can improve air based stats, such as flight energy, by eating "air items," and sea based stats, such as oxygen, by eating sea items.  So essentially, the more you eat in the air, the more you can explore the skies, and the more seafood you eat, the more you can explore the sea.  The ultimate goal, other than getting achievements, is to eat the "big" object of either the sky or the sea.  In the sky, when you reach space- the goal is to become big enough to eat The Moon.  In the sea, you eventually reach Atlantis, and your goal is to eat the God of the Sea- Poseidon.

### Controls

Click/Tap to propel a small burst of flight to the player, just like flappy bird.

The game is incredibily easy to figure out, any form of tutorial seems unnecessary other than maybe a couple of popups.

### Strategy

There isn't really a strategy- just eat what you can, and explore whatever region you want.  There will be achievements, but those are pending a future date.
